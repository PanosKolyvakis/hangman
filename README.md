# hangman milestone3.py

-had some issues with OOP but ended up going around them by inputing class variables which the different methods of the class 
are calling upon to keep the game working. the code includes additional statements such as printing the list of previous guesses 
to ensure that the code is running smoothly.

-defining the vars outside the class also possible - and perhaps easier to edit.

-the list comprehension [print('_') for x in word] prints the lines vertically for some reason, forgot to fix will do later.
